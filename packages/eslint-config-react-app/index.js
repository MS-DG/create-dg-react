// Inspired by https://github.com/airbnb/javascript but less opinionated.

// We use eslint-loader so even warnings are very visible.
// This is why we only use "WARNING" level for potential errors,
// and we don't use "ERROR" level at all.

// In the future, we might create a separate list of rules for production.
// It would probably be more strict.

// The ESLint browser environment defines all browser globals as valid,
// even though most people don't know some of them exist (e.g. `name` or `status`).
// This is dangerous as it hides accidentally undefined variables.
// We blacklist the globals that we deem potentially confusing.
// To use them, explicitly reference them, e.g. `window.name` or `window.status`.
